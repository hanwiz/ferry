  <h3>Welcome!</h3>
  <p>You are remotely monitoring and controlling the AutoFerry in a shore control center (SCC). Your task is to safely transport as many people as possible form one docking station across the channel. The max capacity is 12 people at a time. You decide when the ferry should start. The ferry will move in a straight line across the channel and automatically stop on the other side. The circle around the ferry indicates the status of the anti-collision system. It is green when it functions, yellow when something is detected and red when the system is impaired. The anti-collision system will make the ferry stop when an object is detected within the range of 1.5 meters from the ferry.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can see the status of the technical system on the right side of the interface, shown below. You have three different options for controlling the ferry, and three options for notifying the passengers and surroundings. A short description of the different options follows:

      <strong>Start/Stop</strong>: by pushing this button the ferry immediately stops, push the button again for starting the ferry, it will automatically reach its standard speed of 3kn.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      <strong>Speed up</strong>: increase its speed by 1 kn per push
    </LI>
    <LI>
       <strong>Speed down</strong>: decreases the speed by 1kn per push
    </LI>
    <LI>
       <strong>Signal the surroundings</strong> by sound from an air horn. Length of blast depending on how long you push the button.
    </LI>
    <LI>
       <strong>Communicate to passenger</strong>: Push this button and record your message
    </LI>
    <LI>
       <strong>Maintenance needed!</strong> Push this button to notify the maintenance crew of needed action. The ferry will stop at the next dock for repair, and passengers will be automatically notified that the ferry is out of service.
